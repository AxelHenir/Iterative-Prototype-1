# Iterative-Prototype-1

For the iterative game design process, I will be using my third prototype, my racing game.
It's available here: https://github.com/AxelHenir/Prototype-3-Fixed-Upload

# From the previous playtest...

In the exploration prototype, I learned much of what people inherently understand and what people want when faced with a racing-style game.
I learned what my game lacked on a fundamental level and I hope to implement these features firstly:

- A training area so the player can try the car out
- A dedicated race area that player can choose to start
- Controller Support

I also want to eventually implement these other features:

- Leaderboards with best race times
- Switch cars with a menu
- Minimap and/or road signage
- Engine sounds


# Design Hypothesis

In this iteration of the prototype, I want to try and decide on the focus or specialty of the game. 
I'm leaning towards making this game as a series of challenges where players can improve their times.
I want the game to feel relaxing and easy to play but still provide a sense of skill-expressive maneuvering.

Hypothesis:

Will the player feel comfortable with the driving mechanics if they get the chance to try them in freeplay?
Does this take the stress of racing off of the player and make them more interested in trying races again?
Check for improvement: Does the car feel easy to use?
